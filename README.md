# MotionDetector
This is a Motion Detector implemented using openCV and it uses webcam for detection purposes.

In this project, I have used OpenCV library for detecting the objects which appear in front of the webcam of the PC.It also creates a rectangular box around the objects which are detected by the model.

Along with the normal display, I have also converted the video to Gray scale,Gaussian Blur as well.
